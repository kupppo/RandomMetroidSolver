Circular deps :

rando_escape <> objectives: remove r > o, just an option flag)
new_game <> credits_varia: move new/save/load game stuff from credits into new dedicated patch
tracking <> credits_varia: merge stats stuff from credits_varia into tracking

Refactor:

Objectives :

- credits_varia should contain only credits, move everything else away from it
- stats/credits patch should be usable on a vanilla ROM (with VARIA specific sections filled with default values from patch)

New patches/includes :
- all VARIA base RAM/SRAM and ROM options as defines in common include
- utils.asm : common routines formerly in new_game.asm except check_new_game
- base.asm : boot, save/load/backup management
- start.asm : custom start/varia specific stuff from new_game.asm

Modifications :
- new_game.asm : removed, split into utils and start
- credits_varia.asm : heaviliy stripped of everything but credits, rename to credits
- tracking.asm : augmented with stats stuff from credits_varia, rename to stats

To apply tracking/credits on a vanilla ROM, apply base, stats, credits
