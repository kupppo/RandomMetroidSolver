;;; Fix the crash that occurs when you kill an eye door whilst a eye door projectile is alive
;;; See the comments in the bank logs for $86:B6B9 for details on the bug
;;; The fix here is setting the X register to the enemy projectile index,
;;; which can be done without free space due to an unnecessary RTS in the original code

;;; #$0602 (spring ball specific value) --> #$0002

org $848d0c
	and #$001f

;;; Save station PLM code has a bug where it can spawn two detection PLMs
;;; instead of one. These PLMs are supposed to precisely detect
;;; when Samus is standing on the save. When Samus does, it looks
;;; for a PLM at the same coordinates as itself, which is normally
;;; the actual save station PLM.
;;; But when two detection blocks are spawn, it can detect the other detection
;;; block as being the save, and the save station doesn't work.
;;; That can happen when there are item PLMs in the room with PLM index
;;; lower than the one of the save station. The detection PLMs are then spawned
;;; before the save itself in the PLM list.
;;; Therefore, we add an extra check on PLM type to double check it has
;;; actually found the save station PLM.

;;; positioned correctly

;;; Kraid vomit fix by PJBoy. Avoids garbage tiles in Kraid room when
;;; he's dead and fast doors are enabled.

;;; During horizontal door transitions, the "ready for NMI" flag is set by
;;; IRQ at the bottom of the door as an optimisation,
;;; but the PLM drawing routine hasn't necessarily finished processing
;;; yet.
;;; The Kraid quick kill vomit happens because NMI actually interrupts the
;;; PLM drawing routine for the PLM that clears the spike floor,
;;; *whilst* it's in the middle of writing entries to the $D0 table, which
;;; the NMI processes.
